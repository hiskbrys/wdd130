        <h3>#1 Stephen Curry</h3>
        <p>Stephen Curry is a proven winner. It shows in his ability to take over a game and to become an unstoppable go to option late in the big games. Curry, even at his older age, is averaging an impressive 23ppg, 5.2reb, and 6.7ast. While these numbers seem to be down for someone of Curry's skillset, he has struggled with the injury bug early in this NBA season. The Warriors are a noticeably worse team without him on the court and a top 3 team in the Western Conference with him playing which is why he lands at #1 on my list </p>

        <h3>#2 Anthony Edwards</h3>
        <p>Anthony Edwards has emerged as one of the best scorers in the nba in the last year. His gritty performance in the playoffs had all eyes watching him as he carried the Timberwolves. The most impressive thing about Edwards, also nicknamed "Antman" is he is doing all this at the age of 23! So far this season, Anthony Edwards is averaging a solid 26.2ppg, 5.4reb, and 3.8ast. Although after trading Karl Anthony Towns, the Timberwolves have regressed a bit, it is due to the play of Edwards that keeps them above .500% record.</p>

        <img src="images/doncic.png" alt="Player 3" class="conference-img"> <!-- Replace with your player image -->
        <h3>#3 Luka Dončić</h3>
        <p>Luka Doncic, my favorite NBA player, entered the NBA with high expectations when he was drafted in the 2018 draft with the 3rd overall pick. He has already beaten those expecations and has been one of the leagues best players immediately, even at his young age. Doncic so far in his 2024 season is putting up an impressive 28.9ppg, 8.6reb, and 8.2ast! The 25 year old from Slovenia continues to show he is one of the best offensive players in the NBA and potentially even all time when its all said and done.  </p>

      <!-- Player 4 -->
      <div class="conference-card">
        <img src="images/thebrow.png" alt="Player 4" class="conference-img"> <!-- Replace with your player image -->
        <h3>#4 Anthony Davis</h3>
        <p>Anthony Davis or "the Brow" due to him having a unibrow is one of the most unique NBA players. He dominates on both ends of the floor at all times and in this 2024 season he has been on a pure tear. So far, he is averaging 27.8ppg, 11.4reb, and 3.3ast including 2 blocks per game! Davis has been a huge help to first year coach JJ Redick and the Los Angeles Lakers as they begin their potential move away from the Lebron James era and begin the youth movement in LA. One thing is for certain, Anthony Davis will be in their future plans. </p>

        <h3>#5 Kevin Durant</h3>
        <p>Kevin Durant, who is the best pure scorer the NBA has ever seen in my opinion has always lifted his teams up. His reputation of team hopping haunts him, however he continues to dominate the league full of young stars even at the age of 36. This season he is putting up 25.7ppg, 6.5reb, and 3.7ast. These are numbers that we have grown accustom to for Durant. </p>
