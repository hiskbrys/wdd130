        <h3>#1 Jimmy Butler</h3>
        <p>Jimmy Butler is one of the most swag players in the NBA. He is infamous for carrying teams and giving 110% at all times and doing everything he can to ensure his team comes out on top. While he may not have the flashiest statistics that make you think he makes as much of an impact, his contribution comes on both sides of the ball and he brings the energy needed to lead a team. This year he is averaging 19.4ppg, 6.1reb, and 5.0ast. Jimmy is a floor raiser and can help elavate his teammates around him. The Miami Heat are not the same team without him on the court, however his age is putting him in trade rumours as the Heat may look to begin their new look youth movement with a player who is also on this list that we will get to.</p>

      <div class="conference-card">
        <img src="images/traeyoung.png" alt="Player 2" class="conference-img"> <!-- Replace with your player image -->
        <h3>#2 Trae Young</h3>
        <p>Trae Young can be an electrifying player if he is on one and playing well. He is one of the scorers in the NBA as well as the best point guard who dishes the ball out in my opinion. Trae Young is having a bit of an off year this year averaging 21.5ppg, 4.0reb, and 12.1 ast. When Trae Young plays well, the Hawks can be unstoppable at times, and when he is off, he shoots them out of games. Still at only 26 years old and plenty of young talent around him, I think the best of Young has yet to come. </p>

      <!-- Player 3 -->
      <div class="conference-card">
        <img src="images/antet.png" alt="Player 3" class="conference-img"> <!-- Replace with your player image -->
        <h3>#3 Giannis Antetokounmpo</h3>
        <p>Giannis is one of the most dominating players in both the modern current NBA and also all time. HIs combination of both offense and defense makes him an automatic top 3 player in this league. Although the Bucks have struggled to start the season, Giannis is average 32.7ppg, 11.5reb, and 6.1ast. Now you may be wondering why he is not #1 and it is partly due to him scoring a lot in garbage time and not having a lot of help and having to do most of the work himself. I believe some of his stats are empty stats.</p>

      <!-- Player 4 -->
      <div class="conference-card">
        <img src="images/herro.png" alt="Player 4" class="conference-img"> <!-- Replace with your player image -->
        <h3>#4 Tyler Herro</h3>
        <p>Tyler Herro is one of the leagues most interesting players right now. He seems to always be in trade rumours and then becomes untouchable and repeat. He has stepped big this year for the Miami Heat and has become their true #1 option with Jimmy Butler likely on the move soon and while he is dealing with some injuries. So far, Herro is averaging 24.1ppg, 5.3reb, and 4.8ast. These are almost all career highs for the 24 year old and it is safe to say that he is now the main option for the Heat moving forward and will lead this team for a long time.</p>

      <div class="conference-card">
        <img src="images/lamelo.png" alt="Player 5" class="conference-img"> <!-- Replace with your player image -->
        <h3>#5 Lamelo Ball</h3>
        <p>Lamelo Ball is the top story line of this NBA season. He has been tearing up the league and making ridiculous shots. So far this season with the Hornets, he is averaging 30.2ppg, 5.4reb, and 7.2 ast while being only 23 years of age! He is absolutely crushing it and has yet to have any sort of injury this year which has been the only thing able to hold him back in previous years! The future is bright for Lamelo Ball and he earns a spot on my top 5 in the East!</p>
