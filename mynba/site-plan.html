        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>MY NBA HOME PAGE</h3>
      <p>
        The Home page for my website will serve as an eye popping and welcome to my site. I want and envision my home page to have some pictures that will draw the user to want to remain and stick around as well as participate in reading the content. People will come to my page because they are interested in the nba and in statistics as well as another sports fan opinion on the subjects. I expect my site to answer the question of who my favorite players from each conference are as well as who I believe the best players are from each conference. I want them to come into the website and be excited to see what my opinion is as well as build their own opinions on players as well as to see if I can persuade them to agree with my personal top lists. The information I need is the statistics as well as a little season recap of each player that I am going to be adding to my lists as well as why I am adding them to it. They will want to come to my site because the world of sports web pages are diluted and filled with a lot of "popular player" bias while I will be taking a more objective approach to the top players from each conference. I want to make it easily navigational and for the user to find the secondary pages easily.
